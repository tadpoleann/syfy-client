\nOverview\n\nThis project utilizes the MEAN stack to build the client-side component of the movie app Syfy, based on its existing server-side code. The documentation for the REST API endpoints of the server-side component are described here.\nTech Stack\n\n\nMongoDB\nExpress\nNode\nAngular & Angular-Material\n\nKey Features\n\n\nDisplays a welcome view where uses can sign up or log in\nOnce logged in, users can view all movies and see information about the movies\nUsers can add movies to favorites and remove movies from favorites\nIn profile view, users can view favorite movies and can update their profile information\n\n Getting Started \n\nThis project was generated with Angular CLI version 13.0.2.\nDevelopment server\nRun ng serve for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.\nCode scaffolding\nRun ng generate component component-name to generate a new component. You can also use ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module.\nBuild\nRun ng build to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the dist/ directory.\nRunning unit tests\nRun ng test to execute the unit tests via Karma.\nRunning end-to-end tests\nRun ng e2e to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.\nFurther help\nTo get more help on the Angular CLI use ng help or go check out the Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"modules.html":{"url":"modules.html","title":"modules -
